<h1>File Integrity Monitor</h1>
<p>This project includes the implementation of a robust system that diligently assesses the file integrity by employing continuous hash generations and subsequent comparsions.</p>
<p>The primary objective is to promptly identify the instances of a new file creation, modifications and deletions, thereby ensuring the security and the stability of the monitored system.</p>
<p>In addition to the core functionality, we aim to integrate an intuitive front-end interface in the form of a web page.This interface will serve as the user's window into the monitoring process,presenting data derived from the generated logs in a comprehensible manner.</p>
<p>In addition to this there are also additional features like filtering of some sort and plotting graphs on the web page for these detected changes.</p>
